A working but incomplete Dominion game written on a plane while teaching my girlfriend javascript. Multiple players play in the browser. There is no server (yet) for online play. The "test" cards aren't official dominion cards, but are similar to typical cards from the original game.

Lots of mechanics aren't supported yet, like re-actions, and other situations that call for events to handle cards with more sophistocated rules.
